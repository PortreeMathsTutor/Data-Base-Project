# Data-Base-Project
A high scores table for a Unity game.
I had so much touble trying to make the high score system work that now I think I should 
save my files in a way that will make them easy to use again.
The test project consisted of two scenes.
Scene 1 was menu and game.
Scene 2 was the high score table.
